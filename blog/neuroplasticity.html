          <H3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">Understanding the benefits of neuroplasticity is hugely beneficial to us. It breaks though the misconception that our abilities have been pre detirmined. Understanding that just because we aren't naturally able to perform a task, solve a problem, understand a concept as quickly or as easily as others, doesn't mean that we aren't necessarily as cabable. Adopting this mindset changes the way we view diffiucult situations and allows us to learn and grow from then rather than turn our backs on them.</p>

          <br>

        
          <H3>How you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">physical practise of a challenging concept is a great way to generate neuroplasticity. By carving out new 'roads' in the brain and then repeating the act them will help create new connections and solidify new information.</p>
           

            <br>

        <H3>Some examples of ways we can increase our neuroplasticity</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">Learning something new and challenging, a new language or a musical intrument for example.
              <br>
            as above, physical practise.
            <br>
            Studies also suggest mentally practising a physical skill (imagining you are doing it) helps increase neuroplasticity as well!</p>
