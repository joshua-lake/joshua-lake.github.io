          <H3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</H3>

          <ul class="dashed">
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I've had a fixed growth mindset for a little while</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Ego is the enemy.</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Short, regular breaks when I'm stuck on a problem is great for me. I find myself coming up with new ideas and ways to tackle the problem when I'm away from the computer.</li>
        </ul>

            <br>
        </ul>

        <br>


        <H3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</H3>

        <br>

        <ul class="dashed">
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Being a kind person</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Allowing you to work well in a team and with others</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Being able to learn from other people</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Having the skills to check in with yourself and reflect.</li>
            </ul>


        <br>


            <H3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</H3>

            <p class="sub-main-text-list"> The curriculum itself. It's not something I expected to be learning when I apllied for this course but I'm glad it is a part of it. I believe I understand the value of these skills.</p>
  
            <br>



            <H3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</H3>

            <p class="sub-main-text-list"> Being honest with yourself during reflections, it can be pretty ruthless sometimes!</p>
  
            <br>



            <H3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</H3>

            <p class="sub-main-text-list"> It seems like such an important skillset to have. Not just for professional growth, but for personal growth as well. The ability to be honest with yourself, reflect upon how things were handled and then improve on those skills seems invaluable. The power of perception is amazing.. my favourite Ted Talk video was the 'Super mario effect'.</p>
  
            <br>


            <H3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</H3>

            <p class="sub-main-text-list"> As challenging as it was, I thought it was great. I learnt that I've had a fixed mindset for a little while, if the core curriculum hadn't helped me realise and change that, I might have given up by now!</p>
