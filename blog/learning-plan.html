          <br>

          <H3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">To establish a rewarding career, both personally and financially. Something that challenges and engages me, and provokes me to learn continously.</p>

          <br>
        
          <H3>Strengths and limitations</H3>

        
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li class="small-title"> Strengths</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Attitude</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I believe I've got a good attitude. I like getting stuck in and getting the job done. I feel I have a good problem solving mentality.</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Work well with others in a team</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I enjoy working in a team. To me, helping others is rewarding, and being able to ask others for help is valuable. There's a lot you can learn from your peers!</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Personable</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I like to think I'm polite, friendly, approachable and helpful.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="small-title"> Current limitations</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Problem solving muscle</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> While I think I have the right attitude, the muscle may need some strenghthening!</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Becoming overwhelmed</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I've noticed sometimes when I come under pressure of workloads and deadlines I can freeze up and stress out. This blocks my flow, and can be detrimental to my learning and work output.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
        

          <H3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</H3>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li class="small-title"> Two non technical skills I'd like to improve would be:</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Planning and preparing</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Sometime I can get a bit overexcited and dive straight into a project or task. Being able to improve on my ability to evaluate and pre prepare I think would be valuable to me.</li>
                <li class="mini-title"> Decision Making</li>
                <li class="sub-main-text-list"> This is something I've been continously working on. When I look at senior colleagues I've worked with in the past, they tend to have a great ability to make decisions under pressure.
                    This is something I admire and believe it contributes towards good leadership skills. I realise this comes with experience, but also think mindset and self confidence play a big role.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>


          <H3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme</H3>
          <ul class="dashed">
            <li class="small-title"> An explanation of how I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
            <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I'm in a fortunate position where I can dedicate all my time toward EDA. Having a routine is hugely beneficial to me, getting up early and going to the gym wakes me up and sets me up for the day. I like working a 9-5 structure with a bit of flexability either end. It also means I can not feel guilty while enjoying my downtime as my learning is planned. While this is my routine, it is flexible. Should I need to work hours I normally wouldn't for the sake of a group project, that isn't a problem for me.</li>
            

          </ul>

          <br>

          
          <H3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</H3>
          
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">Ask Google ! If I'm still unsure, when approproiate, ask my fellow students for advice on a challenge, or speak with a facilitator if I'm really stuck or feel it may be a time consuming answer/solve.</p>
        
          <br>
        


          <H3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</H3>
          
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">I expect the facilitation team to be supportive, encouraging and knowledgeable. A team of people that will help guide us on this intensive learning experience, and rather than pick us up, help us up, when we're flailing on the ground in a tail-spin.</p>
