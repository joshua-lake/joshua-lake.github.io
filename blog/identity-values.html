            <H3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</H3>
  
            <p class="sub-main-text-iv">Late last year I decided to move back to New zealand due to the effect Covid was having on my quality of life overseas.
                I was one of many that had been put on the 'job retention' or 'furlough' scheme. Which meant I was employed but wasn't working, and the government were paying 80% of my salary while they tried to get a grip on the virus.</p>
                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">It was early December and the UK was moving towards the peak of it's third outbreak, which included multiple new mutations of the virus. Having luckily secured a spot in MIQ for mid January, I was all set to push the eject button. Or so I thought.</p>
                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">As the cases grew rapidly and the UK plunged deeper into heavier and heavier lockdowns, the NZ government was imposing more departure requirements, airlines and air routes were being shut down left, right and centre. Stories of people giving up their jobs and homes, to have their flight cancelled 3 days before dreparture were rife.</p>
                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">MIQ was fully booked and being able to get on a flight the next day, week or month, should that happen, was definitely off the table.</p>
                <ul class="dashed">
           
                  <li class="small-title"> So, my ethical dilema :</li>
                  
                  <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Tell work I was planning on moving home and give my 1 month notice as normal, but risk being stuck in the country with no income should for any reason I couldn't board that plane.
                    Lockdowns were heavy, businesses were closed, suffering and shutting down permanently. People were losing their jobs. The prospect of finding work and being able to financially support myself on short notice was bleak.</li>

                    <li class="sub-main-text-list"> Or, not tell my employer that I was leaving until I was sure I was on my way home (sitting on the flight). This way, if my flight was cancelled or I tested positive and had to stay in the country, I would have an income/work.
                        Should a project come in, and they ask me back into the office, I wouldnt be available for work. I'd be letting my team down and potentially leaving them in hot water.</li>
                        <br>

                        <p class="sub-main-text-iv">I chose to tell me employer that I was leaving and hand in my 1 month notice as normal. Not doing so felt dishonest, and I could be letting a lot of people down if we needed to spring into action.
                            Fortunately, I tested negative and my flight wasn't cancelled.. I was on my way home!</p>
                    
                            <p class="sub-main-text-iv"> I got lucky and didn't have to face any concequences, but it was all a bit touch and go for a little bit!</p>


                </ul>

                <br>

                <H3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</H3>

                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">I like to think of myself, among many other things, as honest, trusting and friendly. And I think those three things are definitely a product of my cultural environment.<br>
                    I'm a NZ/European, and growing up in NZ is certainly a way of life. We know our neighbours well, we leave out back doors unlocked when we go out. We say 'good morning to each other on our morning walks, runs and outings etc etc...<br>
                    This kind of environment definitely shapes you to be those things throughout your life.</p>



                    <H3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</H3>

        
                    <ul class="dashed">
                        <li class="small-title"> Strengths</li>
                        <li class="mini-title"> Attitude</li>
                        <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I believe I've got a good attitude. I like getting stuck in and getting the job done. I feel I have a good problem solving mentality.</li>
                        <li class="mini-title"> Work well with others in a team</li>
                        <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I enjoy working in a team. To me, helping others is rewarding, and being able to ask others for help is valuable. There's a lot you can learn from your peers!</li>
                        <li class="mini-title"> Personable</li>
                        <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I like to think I'm polite, friendly, approachable and helpful.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="small-title"> Current limitations</li>
                        <li class="mini-title"> Problem solving muscle</li>
                        <li class="sub-main-text-list"> While I think I have the right attitude, the muscle may need some strenghthening!</li>
                        <li class="mini-title"> Becoming overwhelmed</li>
                        <li class="sub-main-text-list"> I've noticed sometimes when I come under pressure of workloads and deadlines I can freeze up and stress out. This blocks my flow, and can be detrimental to my learning and work output.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    <H3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</H3>

                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">I think all strengths can help in your leaning and career development if you implement them in the right way.
                    But for me, the big one is attitide! If you've got the right attitude, people will enjoy working with you, people will teach you things, you will learn quicker, among so many other positives.</p>








                    <H3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</H3>

                <p class="sub-main-text-iv">A couple of years ago, a band I played in decided collectively that we'd like to record an album.</p>
                    <p class="sub-main-text-iv">This is a pretty big undertaking for any musician/band. It requires a lot of personal time, effort, commitment and finances from all parties involved.
                    I like to describe the recording process to anyone that hasn't experienced it as like 'going to the dentist' for musicians. The fun stuff is the playing - practising, writing, creating, gigging etc.
                    Recording usually consists of you sitting by yourself, with your instrument, repeatedly playing the same thing over and over again, while the rest of your band mates tell you it's not good enough (yet!), and to do it agian (for the 37th time and counting).</p>
            
                    <p class="sub-main-text-iv">While going through this process, our lead singer was losing interest. The stuff he was recording was being batted back by our bassist/ constantly.
                    He became deflated and lost his confidence, so productivity dipped and the process soon started coming to a halt.</p>
            
                    <p class="sub-main-text-iv"> the time, the strategies we used were to put pressure on the singer to complete his work. We reminded him how much money we had all contributed and that it would be unfair on all of us should this project go unfinished.
                    This didn't work all that well, he started becoming ellusive and we all starting becoming frustrated.</p>
            
                    <p class="sub-main-text-iv">Reflecting on this, I think a more productive strategy would have been to speak to him in a one on one situation, away from the group. Find out what was going on and how we could have helped.
                    Instead of reminding him how much money we had put in, remind him how far we had come and how close we all were to achieving what we set out to do.
                    More encouragement, empathy and support.</p>
