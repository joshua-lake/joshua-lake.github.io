          <H3>What are the differences between HTML and CSS?</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">Think of HTML and CSS as the builder and the decorator - HTML is the content of our website - Someone who 'builds the house', the walls the stairs, the doors etc. Think of CSS as our 'decorator'. We'll use CSS to colour and style our doors, walls, curtains etc. Our decorator makes everything look nice.</p>

          <br>

        
          <H3>Control flow and loops</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">We could look at 'control flow' and 'loops' using the analogy of washing dishes. Control flow is the order a set of instructions might be executed. For example, when we wash dishes, we would > fill the sink with water and soap > scrub the dirty plate > place in a drying rack. A loop is a function that happens until it is told to stop. For example, we would scrub the plate and stop once it was clean.
            <br>  
            > scrub plate > is it clean? > no > repeat
            <br>
            > scrub plate > is it clean? > no > repeat
            <br>
            > scrub plate > is it clean? > yes > stop scrubbing plate.</p>
           

            <br>

        <H3>What is the DOM? When might we interact with it?</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">The Dom, or the 'Document Object Model' is an object based representation of our source code structured by what is called a 'node tree'. It's a platform for one piece of software to speak to another piece of software. We would interact with the DOM if we were to use javascript to access and change our HTML. </p>



          <br>

        <H3>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">An object represents a 'thing' (e.g house, person, car) and has properties within it. An array is basically a list of multiple items. We would access the information within our objects by specifying which propertie we'd like to access. For example, if we had a person as an object, we might access the information in their 'age' property by specifying 'age'. Where as with an array we would specify which number on the list we need. Imagine we had a shopping list and we wanted to point to the 10th thing on that list, we would specify the number 10. (An important point to remember - computers start counting from 0! Which means the first thing on our list will be 0, the second will be 1, and so on.)</p>

          <br>

        <H3>What are functions and why are they useful?</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">Functions are a way of setting out a list of intructions, that perform tasks or calculate values, to be actioned. When we call on the function, the actions within the function will triggered.
            <br>
            Functions are useful because we can apply them to multiple instances without having to re-write or copy the code over and over again.</p>
