          <H3>Got blocked on a simple problem : </H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
              While doing the FizzBuzz challenge, I fell pretty short at the first hurdle.. How to identify all multiples of a number. The first thing I did was jump onto Google, but didn't have much luck there. So I reached out to my facilitator who was able to set me straight and help me fully understand the remainder operator. It was pretty frustrating stumbling at the first hurdle but having someone explain a concept one on one is a great way to solidfy the knowledge of how something might work.
            </p>

          <br>

        
          <H3>Solved a problem in an elegant way :</H3>

          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
              Not a code related problem.. When I was working in VFX, we had some footage come in that was in the wrong resolution. We were having issues converting it without affecting the colourspace. After asking some peers for help and some googling, I was able to get the conversion done. I actually enjoyed solving this problem because I felt like I had the tools to do so, and I learnt a new technique to convert footage!
            </p>
           

            <br>

            
          <p class="main-text-mbp">Problem solving techniques</p>

            
            <H3>Psuedocode</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            As someone who is new to programming, this technique is completely new to me. However, over the last 2 sprints I've certainly come to realise how important using psuedocode can be. Being able to articulate the code in an everyday language helps identify exactly what you are trying to achieve, or what's going wrong and how you're going to go about fixing it.
        </p>

          <H3>Trying something</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            This is my favourite, I like getting stuck in! Although I need to be a bit careful as sometimes a more restrained aproach would be more logical.. Psuedocode for example!
        </p>

          <br>

          <H3>Rubber ducky method</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            Another method I quite like. Externalising the problem can be very helpful in some situations. I've drawn up my own rubber ducky on my whiteboard.. 'Perry the Panda'!
        </p>

          <br>

          <H3>Reading error messages</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            Confident in reading where the error is, but some of the messages are still a little unclear to me.
        </p>

          <br>

          <H3>Console.logging</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            Another new one for me, and not overly confident with this one. I understand how it works, but at times uncertain where in the code I should be putting the console.log or which part of a function I should be console.logging out.
        </p>

          <br>


          <H3>Googling</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            Pretty familiar and confident with ol' Dr Google.
        </p>

          <br>


          <H3>Asking your peers for help</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            When appropriate, this is a great way to share knowledge. Teaching something is the best way to reitierate it for yourself so people in learning spaces tend to be very happy to help out
        </p>

          <br>


          <H3>Asking coaches for help</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            Just today i spent some time on a call with my foundations facilitator. They were very helpful and talked me through the issues I was facing and helped me understand some concepts I was struggling with.
        </p>

          <br>



          <H3>Improving your process with reflection</H3>
            
          <p class="sub-main-text-list">
            I like this. Reflecting  provides a way to be honest with yourself and acknowledge the mistakes you might have made and learn from them.
        </p>
